# GRU-in-Stock-Prediction
Stock price prediction of Indian Tech companies
I have taken the database of INFOSYS as an example.
The model has four GRU layers and has tanh as an activation function.

The metrics used to evalute the model are:
  RMSE
  MSE
  MAPE
  R^2
The next future values of 60 are also predicted to check the validity of the model.
